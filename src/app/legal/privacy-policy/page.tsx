        finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the
        security of your account and other data that we hold in our records,
        please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or
        storing data is completely secure. We retain Personal Data about you for

        consumers with specific rights regarding their Personal Data. This
        section describes these rights and explains how to exercise them. ####
        a. Right to Know About Personal Data You have the right to request that
        we disclose certain information to you about our collection, disclosure,
        sale and use of your Personal Data. Once we receive and verify your
        request, we will disclose to you the following (to the extent applicable
        to your request): - The specific pieces of Personal Data we collected
        about you in the preceding twelve (12) months; - The categories of
        Personal Data that we have collected about you in the preceding 12
        months; - Categories of Personal Data that we disclosed or sold for a
        Business Purpose in the preceding 12 months; - The categories of sources
        from which we have collected this Personal Data, - The commercial or
        business reason(s) for having collected, used, disclosed, or sold that
        Personal Inform Data; and - The categories of third parties to whom we
        have disclosed or sold your Personal Data in the preceding 12 months.
        You may exercise this right up to two times in any 12-month period. ####
        b. Right to Request Deletion You may also have the right to request
        deletion of your Personal Data. We will honor such request, but might
        not be able to fulfill your request if we (or our service providers) are
        required to retain your Personal Data. Examples of such exceptions are:
        - Completing a transaction or performing a contract we have with you; -
        Detecting and addressing data security incidents, and repairing or
        upkeep of our IT systems; - Protecting against fraud or other illegal
        activity; - Complying with applicable law or a legal obligation, or to
        exercise rights under the law (e.g. the right to free speech); or -
        Using your Personal Data internally to improve our Services. #### c.
        Exercising Your Privacy Rights To exercise the rights described above,
        please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either: using the
        following methods: Email: support@litprotocol.com Online Form:
        [https://nut.sh/ell/forms/352580/YEk9vu](https://nut.sh/ell/forms/352580/YEk9vu)
        ##### i. What we need to know to fulfill your request The verifiable
        consumer request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us
        to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal
        Data or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request
        with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate,
        and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with
        Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the
        request and confirm the Personal Data related to you. Making a
        verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account
        with us. Typically, accounts associated with an email address will
        require verification of the email address, as well as a description of
        the requested user rights or regulations invoked. Lit also values those
        who are not covered by specific regulations, and offers to extend a good
        will effort towards requests originating from other jurisdictions. #####
        ii. How you will hear back from us We will confirm receipt of a
        verifiable consumer request within ten (10) business days of its
        receipt. We will endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request
        within forty-five (45) calendar days of its receipt. If we require more
        time, we will notify you of the extension and provide an explanation of
        the reason for the extension in writing, and we will provide you with a
        response no later than ninety (90) calendar days of receipt of the
        request. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written
        response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will
        deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
        The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply
        with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will
        select a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable
        and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to
        another entity without hindrance. We may charge a reasonable fee to
        process or respond to your verifiable consumer requests if they are
        excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the
        request warrants a fee, we will inform you of the reasons for this
        decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your
        request. #### d. Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Data We will
        not sell your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12
        months. #### e. Right to Non-Discrimination We will not discriminate
        against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. We will not (i) deny
        you products or services, (ii) charge you different prices or rates for
        products or services, including through granting discounts or other
        benefits, or imposing penalties (except for financial incentives
        permitted by the CCPA, see below), (iii) provide you a different level
        or quality of products or services, and (iv) suggest that you may
        receive a different price or rate for products or services or a
        different level or quality of products or services. #### f. Right to
        Designate an Authorized Agent If you submit a request to know or delete
        your Personal Data through the use of an authorized agent, we may
        require that you (i) provide the authorized agent written permission to
        act on your behalf, and (ii) verify their identity directly with us. We
        may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof
        of authorization. - Other California Privacy Rights Pursuant to Section
        1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the
        right to obtain certain information about the types of personal
        information that companies with whom they have an established business
        relationship (and that are not otherwise exempt) have shared with third
        parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar
        year, including the names and addresses of those third parties, and
        examples of the types of services or products marketed by those third
        parties. In order to submit such a request, please contact us at
        support@litprotocol.com. Please note, however, that we do not disclose
        Personal Data to third parties for such third parties' direct marketing
        purposes. - Changes to Our CCPA Notice This CCPA Notice is effective as
        of the date of the Last Update stated at the top of this CCPA Notice. We
        may change this CCPA Notice from time to time with or without notice to
        you. By visiting or accessing the Website or the Services, purchasing
        products or services from us, or otherwise engaging or interacting with
        us after we make any such changes to this CCPA Notice, you are deemed to
        have accepted such changes. Please be aware that, to the extent
        permitted by applicable law, and without prejudice to the foregoing, our
        use of your Personal Data is governed by the CCPA Notice in current
        effect. Please refer back to this CCPA Notice on a regular basis.
        **Contact Information** If you have any questions or comments about this
        CCPA Notice, the ways in which we collect and use your information, your

        ## GDPR Privacy Notice to European Residents If you are a resident of
        the European Union ("EU"), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or
        Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data
        Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") with respect to your Personal Data,
        as outlined in this GDPR Addendum (the "GDPR Addendum"). For this GDPR
        Addendum, we use the terms "Personal Data" and "processing" as they are
        defined in the GDPR, but "Personal Data" generally means information
        that can be used to identify a person, and "processing" generally refers
        to actions that can be performed on data such as its collection, use,
        storage or disclosure. Lit will usually be the controller of your
        Personal Data processed in connection with the Services. Note that we
        may also process Personal Data of our customers' end users or employees
        in connection with our provision of certain services to customers, in
        which case we may be the processor of Personal Data. If we are the
        processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please
        contact the controller party in the first instance to address your
        rights with respect to such data. Where applicable, this GDPR Addendum
        is intended to supplement, and not replace, our Privacy Policy. If there
        are any conflicts between the GDPR Addendum and the other parts of the
        Privacy Policy, and you are a resident of the EU, United Kingdom,
        Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, the provision that is more protective
        of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you
        have any questions about this section or whether any of the following
        rights apply to you, please contact us at support@litprotocol.com.
        **Types of Personal Data we Collect** We currently collect and otherwise
        process the kinds of Personal Data listed above in Section I ("Personal
        Data We Collect and Share") of the Privacy Policy. **How we Get the
        Personal Data and why we Have it** We receive the Personal Data in the
        ways and for the purposes listed above in Section III ("Sources of
        Personal Data") and Section IV (Why we Collect, Use and Share Your
        Data") of the Privacy Policy. We will only process your Personal Data if
        we have a lawful basis for doing so. Under the GDPR, the lawful bases we
        rely on for processing this information are: a) **Your Consent** In some
        cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant
        to us at the time we collect such data. When we process Personal Data
        based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the
        point and time of collection. You can remove your consent at any time.
        You can do this by contacting us via email at support@litprotocol.com
        with the subject line "GDPR Request." b) **We Have a Contractual
        Obligation** We process certain categories of Personal Data as a matter
        of 'contractual necessity', meaning that we need to process the data to
        perform under our Terms of Use with you, which enables us to provide you
        with the Services. When we process data due to contractual necessity,
        failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to
        use some or all portions of the Services that require such data. These
        categories of Personal Data are: - Profile or Contact Data - Device/IP
        Data - Geolocation Data c) **We Have a Legitimate Interest** We process
        the following categories of Personal Data when we believe it furthers
        the legitimate interest of us or third parties: - Profile or Contact
        Data - Device/IP Data - Geolocation Data Our legitimate interests are: -
        Information Security: We process contact information, and the
        information collected through cookies and when you use the Services in
        order to maintain an audit log of activities performed. We use this
        information pursuant to our legitimate interests in tracking usage,
        combating DDOS or other attacks, and removing or defending against
        malicious individuals or programs. - Operation and Improvement of our
        Services: We process server log information and information collected
        through cookies pursuant to our legitimate interest in operating and
        improving our Services. - Audience Measurement and Retargeting: Pursuant
        to a user's consent, we use analytics cookies, and collect identifiers
        through such cookies, for purposes of audience measurement, analytics,
        audience reaction to the Services, and creating relevant user
        experiences. - General Business Development and Management: We process
        Personal Data pursuant to our legitimate interest in creating and
        managing our business relationships with European Individuals, including
        without limitation: - To respond to inquiries from European Individuals;
        - To provide European Individuals with information about our products
        and services; and - To assist European Individuals with any issues while
        using the Services. - Direct Marketing: Generally, we send email
        marketing to European Individuals pursuant to their consent. When you
        use the Website, email marketing may be sent to you pursuant to our
        legitimate interest in sending marketing communications to you in the
        context of such engagement. - Protection of Rights: We may also disclose
        Personal Data to respond to claims of violation of third party rights or
        to enforce and protect our rights. d) **We Have a Legal Obligation** We
        may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests
        by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national
        security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose Personal
        Data to other third parties when compelled to do so by government
        authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited
        to, in response to court orders and subpoenas. **How we Share Your
        Personal Data** Section I ("Personal Data We Collect and Share") and
        Section IV ("Why we Collect, Use and Share Your Data") of the Privacy
        Policy explain how we share your Personal Data with third parties. **How
        we Store and Protect Your Personal Data** We use commercially reasonable
        administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your
        Personal Data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure,
        alteration, or destruction, for which we take into account the nature of
        the Personal Data, its processing, and the threats posed to it.
        Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed
        to be secure at all times. If you have reason to believe that your
        interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us
        via email at support@litprotocol.com. We retain your Personal Data for
        as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which we obtained it, as
        further described in this Privacy Policy. We will only keep your
        Personal Data for as long as allowed or required by law. **Your Data
        Protection Rights** You have certain rights with respect to your
        Personal Data, including those set forth below. For more information
        about these rights, or to submit a request, please email us at
        support@litprotocol.com. You are not required to pay any charge for
        exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to
        respond to you. Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be
        able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or
        extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it
        is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still
        respond to notify you of such a decision. In some cases, we may also
        need you to provide us with additional information, which may include
        Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of
        your request. - **Right of access**: You can request more information
        about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy of such
        Personal Data. - **Right to rectification**: If you believe that any
        Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you
        can request that we correct or supplement such data. Users of Lit can
        also correct some of this information (for example, email address)
        directly by logging on to your account. - **Right to erasure**: You can
        request that we erase some or all of your Personal Data from our
        systems. - **Right to restriction of processing**: You have the right to
        ask us to restrict the processing of your Personal Data. - **Right to
        object to processing**: You have the the right to object to the
        processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances. - **Right to
        data portability**: You can ask for a copy of your Personal Data in a
        machine-readable format. You can also request that we transmit the data
        to another controller where technically feasible. - **Right to withdraw
        consent**: If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent
        (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the
        right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that
        if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent
        on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your
        Personal Data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to
        utilize some or all of our Services. - **Objecting to Legitimate
        Interest/Direct Marketing**: You may object to Personal Data processed
        pursuant to our legitimate interest. In such case, we will no longer
        process your Personal Data unless we can demonstrate appropriate,
        overriding legitimate grounds for the processing or if needed for the
        establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. You may also object
        at any time to processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing
        purposes by clicking "Unsubscribe" within an automated marketing email
        or by submitting your request to support@litprotocol.com with the
        subject line "GDPR Request." In such case, your Personal Data will no
        longer be used for that purpose. **How to Complain** If you have any
        concerns about our use of your Personal Data, you can make a complaint
        to us at support@litprotocol.com with the subject line "GDPR Request."
        You also have the right to lodge a complaint about the processing of
        your personal data with a supervisory authority of the European state
        where you work or live or where any alleged infringement of data
        protection laws occurred. A list of most of the supervisory authorities
        can be found here:
        [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm).
        **Corporate Restructuring** In the event of a merger, reorganization,
        dissolution, or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or
        substantially all of our assets, the information that we have collected,
        including Personal Data, may be transferred to the surviving or
        acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments
        with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such Personal Data as
        set forth in this GDPR Addendum. **Transfers of Personal Data** The
        Services are hosted and operated in the Switzerland ("Switzerland")

        third party, is being provided to Lit in the Switzerland. and will be
        hosted on global servers, and you authorize Lit to transfer, store and
        process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other
        countries. You hereby consent to the transfer of your data to the U.S.
        pursuant to a data processing agreement incorporating the modernized
        standard contractual clauses for the transfer of Personal Data to third
        countries promulgated by the European Commission on 4 June 2021, a copy
        of which can be obtained at

        process your Personal Data for a purpose other than that which it was
        collected, we will provide you with information on that purpose and any
        other relevant information at a reasonable time prior to such
