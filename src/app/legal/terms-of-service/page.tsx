        products, services and applications (the "Services") that are made
        available to you through our Website and other platforms, subject to the
        following terms and conditions (the "Terms"). These Terms are a binding
        contract between you and Lit. By accessing and using the Website and/or
        the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree
        to be legally bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy (the "Privacy
        Policy"), which is hereby incorporated into these Terms and made a part
        hereof by reference (collectively, the "Agreement"). If you do not agree
        to any of the terms in the Agreement, you may not access or use the
        Website and/or the Services. If you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf
        of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are
        authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity's
        behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to
        "you" and "your" in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to
        that organization or entity.). In addition, if you are a developer, then
        your access to and use of our API and/or SDK shall be governed by the
        Developer API & SDK License Agreement. If there is a conflict between
        these Terms and the terms and conditions of the Developer API & SDK
        License Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Developer API & SDK
        License Agreement will take precedence with respect to your use of or

        UNDERSTAND THAT ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF
        YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR PARTICIPATION IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT
        OR A JURY TRIAL. Capitalized terms not defined in these Terms of Service
        shall have the meaning set forth in our Privacy Policy. If you have any
        questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services,
        please contact us at support@litprotocol.com. ## Will these Terms ever
        change? We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need
        to change these Terms along with the Services. We reserve the right to
        change the Terms at any time, with or without notice to you. If we
        modify the Terms, we will post the modification on the Website and the
        Services. By continuing to access or use the Website and/or the Services
        after we have posted a modification on the Website and the Services, you
        are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Agreement. If
        the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, your only recourse is
        to cease using the Site and the Services. We may suspend or discontinue
        any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose
        limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the
        Services. We reserve the right to remove any Content (defined below)
        from the Services at any time, for any reason in our sole discretion,
        and without notice. You will only use the Services for your own
        internal, personal use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any
        third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply
        to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws or
        regulations, then you aren't authorized to use the Services. If permits
        and licenses are required for you to use the Services, you must first
        obtain those prior to such use. We can't and won't be responsible for
        your using the Services in a way that breaks the law or regulations. ##
        What about my privacy? Lit takes the privacy of its users very
        seriously. For the current Lit User Privacy Policy, please visit
        [https://litprotocol.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://litprotocol.com/legal/privacy-policy).
        ## What are the basics of using Lit? The Services enable passwordless
        authentication and login functionality to distributedly managed keys as
        well as access control for various sites and applications whose
        developers have implemented our software ("Developer Apps"). If the
        developer has integrated with our Lit software, you will have to create
        an account to login to a given Developer App and your account on each
        Developer App is managed by the developer of the applicable Developer
        App. Lit has no control or access to your accounts on the Developer Apps
        and is not responsible or liable for your accounts and/or the use or
        misuse of your accounts. You can find a description of our Service
        options on our website, and we will explain additional Service options
        that are available to you from time-to-time. Certain Service options are
        provided to you free-of-charge, but we reserve the right to charge for
        certain or all Services in the future. We will notify you before any
        Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to
        continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such
        Services. As part of our Services, you may directly or indirectly create
        a digital wallet that can store and transfer certain supported Virtual
        Currency (defined below) (your "Wallet"). In order to use Lit's Services
        and create a Wallet, you will be required to established and
        authenticate via a variety of authorization credentials in order to
        access your Wallet in order to allow you to initiate a transfer of
        Virtual Currency from your Wallet, as described further below. Lit
        allows Developer Apps to use a variety of authorization credentials to
        create an account linked to your Wallet. You shall not provide us with
        another person's authorization credentials, such as phone number or
        email address. Lit also offers multi-factor authentication as an added
        security measure, and if you choose to participate, you may need to
        provide credentials. If you do not establish multi-factor
        authentication, you may be unable to access your account or your Wallet
        and we will be unable to assist you, so please make sure to follow any
        instructions associated with enabling multi-factor authentication. When
        you create a Wallet with Lit, a cryptographic private and public key
        pair is generated. The private and public key pair together evidence
        ownership/possession of a specific amount of supported Virtual Currency
        in that Wallet which enables you to send and receive Virtual Currency
        via the relevant Blockchain (as defined below) network. The public key
        is visible to all participants in a Blockchain's network. The private
        key must be used to transact the Virtual Currency represented by the
        corresponding public key. Lit does not store your whole private key in
        its database and will never request your private key. Lit utilizes
        AMD-SEV-SNP and threshold cryptography and its own technology to manage
        your private key in a process designed to help ensure its security and
        confidentiality while ensuring that you remain in control of your Wallet
        and private key. Once your private key is generated, Lit’s software
        enables you to initiate a transfer of Virtual Currency using your
        authorization credentials, like phone number or oAuth, instead of your
        private key as further described below. You may also choose to export
        your private key to initiate a transfer of Virtual Currency using
        another software platform or dashboard. Please note, if you choose to
        export your private key to your Wallet, you will be solely responsible
        for maintaining the security of that private key and your Wallet. When
        you request to make a transfer of Virtual Currency, in order to initiate
        such transfer you will be required to request that Lit validate your
        authorization credentials. If you have multi-factor authentication
        enabled, you may also be required to take additional steps. You may only
        initiate a transfer using Lit's Services after 2/3rds of the network
        have confirmed receipt of a valid Transfer Initiation. Lit is entitled
        to rely on the Transfer Initiation and has no duty to inquire into or
        investigate the validity or accuracy of any Transfer Initiation, though
        it may, at its sole discretion, inquire into or investigate such
        Transfer Initiation. You will be responsible for keeping your
        authorization credentials secure and for any activity associated with
        your Wallet. Lit will not be responsible if someone else accesses your
        phone or computer and authorizes a transaction upon access to your
        authorization credentials. You should let Lit know immediately if your
        authorization credentials have been stolen or otherwise compromised. Lit
        cannot access raw private key information for you, and we cannot
        unilaterally initiate a transfer of Virtual Currency or otherwise access
        your Virtual Currency. We are not your brokers, intermediaries, agents,
        advisors, or custodians, and we do not have a fiduciary relationship or
        obligation to you regarding any other decisions or activities that you
        effect when using your Wallet or our Services. We are not responsible
        for any activities that you engage in when using your Wallet, and you
        should understand the risks associated with Virtual Currency described
        more fully below. You are solely responsible for any and all Transfer
        Initiations that are initiated through your Wallet and we make no, and
        hereby disclaim all, representations, warranties, claims and assurances
        as to any Transfer Initiations. "Virtual Currency" refers to
        cryptocurrency, digital currency, digital assets, cryptoassets or other
        such similar term describing, for example, Ethereum, but does not
        include a derivative of a virtual currency or a security. Virtual
        Currency is evidenced on, and can be electronically transferred using, a
        Blockchain. "Blockchain" refers to a distributed ledger, maintained by a
        network of computers, that records all transactions of Virtual Currency
        in theoretically unchangeable data packages known as blocks, each of
        which are timestamped to reference the previous block, so that the
        blocks are linked in a chain that evidences the entire history of
        transactions of the Virtual Currency. Your use of the Services is
        subject to the following additional restrictions: You represent,
        warrant, and agree that you will not use the Services or interact with
        the Services in a manner that: - Infringes or violates the intellectual
        property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including Lit); -
        Violates any law or regulation, including, without limitation, any
        ⁠applicable export control laws and sanctions laws, including
        restrictions tha prohibit access or use of products or services (i) in a
        country where the U.S. maintains an embargo (including Cuba, Iran, North
        Korea, Syria and the Crimea region, the Donetsk People’s Republic
        (“DNR”) and Luhansk People’s Republic (“LNR”) of Ukraine) (“Embargoed
        Countries”); (ii) by any resident, national, or entity established under
        the laws of any Embargoed Countries; (iii) by any party that is on any
        list of prohibited or restricted parties maintained by the U.S.
        Government or other applicable jurisdictions, including but not limited
        to Office of Foreign Asset Control’s (OFAC) Specially Designated
        Nationals and Blocked Persons List, or other OFAC Lists or Directives,
        the Entity, Denied Persons, Military End User, and Unverified Lists
        maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the UN Security
        Council Consolidated List; (iv) by any party that is owned or controlled
        by any such restricted or prohibited party; or (v) for the commission of
        any financial crime or for any illicit purpose; Is harmful, fraudulent,
        deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise
        objectionable; Jeopardizes the security of your Lit account or anyone
        else's (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);
        - Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other
        security information from any other user; - Violates the security of any
        computer network, or cracks any authorization credentials; or - Attempts
        to access another user's account, Wallet or private key or credentials
        on any third-party services that provide access to another user's
        account, Wallet or private key. A violation of any of the foregoing is
        grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services. ##
        Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk Associated with Virtual
        Currency and Your Wallet In order to be successfully completed, any
        Virtual Currency transaction created with or sent to your Wallet must be
        confirmed and recorded in a Blockchain associated with the relevant
        Virtual Currency. Lit has no control over any Blockchain and therefore
        cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit or
        receive via our Services will be confirmed on the relevant Blockchain
        and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or
        modification requests. You agree and understand that: - You: (a) have
        the necessary technical expertise, ability or professional advice
        required to review and evaluate the security, integrity and operation of
        your Wallet to your satisfaction; (b) have the knowledge, experience,
        understanding, professional advice and information to make your own
        evaluation of the merits, risks and applicable compliance requirements
        under applicable laws of any use of your Wallet; (c) know, understand
        and accept the risks associated with your Wallet; and (d) accept the
        risks associated with Virtual Currency generally and are responsible for
        conducting your own independent analysis of the risks specific to any
        Virtual Currency. - You further assume and agree that Lit will have no
        responsibility or liability for, such risks. You hereby irrevocably
        waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to
        you, against Lit, its affiliates and their respective shareholders,
        members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives
        related to any of the risks set forth herein. - You take responsibility
        for all activities that occur under your Wallet or with Virtual Currency
        sent from your Wallet and accept all risks of any authorized or
        unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by
        law. - Virtual Currency is an emerging asset class. Lit makes no
        warranties as to the markets in which the Virtual Currency are
        transferred, purchased and traded. - You acknowledge and accept that the
        loss or destruction of authorization credentials will compromise the
        security of your Wallet and Virtual Currency and may result in loss of
        Virtual Currency. - In the event that you extract your private key to
        your Wallet as further described in these Terms, you acknowledge and
        accept that you will be solely responsible for maintaining the security
        of your private key, and that the loss or destruction of your private
        key will compromise the security of your Wallet and Virtual Currency and
        may result in loss of Virtual Currency. - The transaction details you
        submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially
        delayed, by the relevant Blockchain used to process the transaction. -
        There are no warranties or guarantees that a transfer initiated on the
        Services will successfully transfer title or right in any Virtual
        Currency. - Once transaction details have been submitted to a
        Blockchain, Lit cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your
        transaction or transaction details. - Lit is not regulated by any
        federal or state regulatory agency and is not subject to the examination
        or reporting requirements of any such agencies. - Lit does not assume
        responsibility for any inherent risks associated with Blockchain
        technology, including, but not limited to, design or implementation
        flaws that affect the operation of any Blockchain. Furthermore, Lit does
        not assume responsibility for any issues relating to the continuing
        viability of a Blockchain, including, but not limited to, the ability to
        retain the technical expertise required to support a Blockchain or the
        performance of a Blockchain with respect to transaction times. - Lit
        makes no guarantee as to the functionality of any Blockchain's
        governance or control mechanisms, which could, among other things, lead
        to delays, conflicts of interest, or operational decisions that are
        unfavorable to certain owners of Virtual Currency. You acknowledge and
        accept that the protocols governing the operation of a Blockchain may be
        subject to sudden changes in operating rules which may materially alter
        the Blockchain and affect the value and function of Virtual Currency
        evidenced on that Blockchain. - Lit does not assume responsibility for
        fundamental advancements in cryptography which could render inoperative
        the current cryptography algorithms utilized by a Blockchain supporting
        a specific Virtual Currency. - Lit makes no guarantee as to the security
        of any Blockchain. Lit is not liable for any hacks, double spending,
        stolen Virtual Currency, or any other attacks on a Blockchain,
        including, but not limited to, majority attacks in which a nation-state
        or other party with sufficient computing power is able to control and
        manipulate the records of a Blockchain. - Lit makes no guarantees as to
        the security of AMD-SEV-SNP and is not liable for any hacks or attacks
        on AMD’s systems. - Lit is not liable for any hacks or malicious
        attempts or phishing scams to obtain access to your Wallet via your
        authorization credentials, such as email address or phone. You alone are
        responsible for ensuring that you do not provide your authorization
        credentials to any other person and or entity. ## What are my rights in
        the Services? The materials displayed or performed or available on or
        through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics,
        data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, and so forth (all of the

        prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that
        violates someone else's (including Lit’s) rights. You are the sole owner
        of the Virtual Currency in your Wallet and may elect to extract your
        private key or otherwise transfer your Virtual Currency to another
        wallet, subject to any limitations set forth in these Terms. You
        understand that, excluding any open source software or third-party
        software that the Services incorporate, Lit owns the Services including
        all technology, Content and other materials used, displayed or provided
        in connection with the Services (including all intellectual property
        rights subsisting therein), and hereby grants you a limited, revocable,
        non-transferable, license to access and use the Services. You
        acknowledge that the Services may use, incorporate or link to certain
        open-source components and that your use of the Services is subject to,
        and you will comply with any, applicable open source licenses that
        govern any such open-source components (collectively, "Open-Source

        not: (a) modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale
        of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section or, in the
        event you are a developer, as provided in our Terms of Service and
        [Developer API & SDK License Agreement] the Services or (b) otherwise
        use the Services in a manner that violates the licenses granted in these
        Terms or any other Open-Source Licenses. Any of Lit’s product or service

        the Services? Any third-party goods or services, information or content
        publicly posted or privately transmitted or made available through the
        Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such goods,
        services or content originated, and you obtain such goods or services
        and access all such information and content at your own risk, and we
        aren't liable for any errors or omissions or for any damages or losses
        you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no
        duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the
        Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed
        to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you
        having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can't
        guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the
        Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the
        Services. With respect to all e-mails and communications you send to us,
        including, but not limited to, feedback, questions, comments,
        suggestions, and the like, we shall be free to use any ideas, concepts,
        know-how, or techniques contained in your communications for any purpose
        whatsoever, including but not limited to, the development, production,
        and marketing of products and services that incorporate such information
        without compensation or attribution to you. You represent and warrant
        you have all rights necessary to provide any of the foregoing, in the
        manner in which you provide it to us. You will keep all your
        registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for
        all your activity in connection with the Services. The Services may
        contain links or connections to third party websites, applications or
        services that are not owned or controlled by Lit, and typically, you
        will access our Services through third party websites, applications or
        services that integrate with our Services. When you access third party
        websites or applications, or when you use third party services, you
        accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Lit is not responsible
        for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services
        and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each
        third-party website or service that you visit or utilize. Lit has no
        control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy,

        third-party websites or by any third party that you interact with
        through the Services. In addition, Lit will not and cannot monitor,
        verify, censor or edit the content of any third-party site or service.
        Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or
        through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or
        services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations
        associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such
        organizations and/or individuals. By using the Services, you release and
        hold us harmless from any and all liability, losses or damages arising
        from your use of any third-party website or service. If there is a
        dispute between participants of the Services, or between users and any
        third party, you agree that Lit is under no obligation to become
        involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other
        users, you release Lit, its officers, employees, agents, and successors
        from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or
        unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out
        of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you
        are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California
        Civil Code Section 1542, which says: \"A general release does not extend
        to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect
        to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and
        that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her
        settlement with the debtor or released party." ## What if I want to stop
        using the Services? You're free to do that at any time; please refer to
        our User Privacy Policy to understand how we treat information you
        provide to us after you have stopped using our Services. If you would
        like to stop using the Services and export the contents of your Wallet,

        Upon electing to export your private key, you will be able to download a
        copy of, or directly copy, your private key associated with the Wallet
        you are using with Lit (the "Private Key Copy") by following
        instructions provided by Lit. Once Lit has provided you access to your
        Private Key Copy, you acknowledge and agree that: LIT DISCLAIMS ANY AND
        ALL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PRIVATE KEY COPY AND ANY VIRTUAL
        CURRENCY THAT WAS CONTAINED IN YOUR WALLET ON LIT'S SERVICES. YOU ALONE
        WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR PRIVATE KEY COPY AND
        KEEPING SUCH PRIVATE KEY COPY SECURE, AND LIT WILL NOT ASSIST YOU WITH
        STORING YOUR PRIVATE KEY COPY. IF YOU LOSE ACCESS TO YOUR PRIVATE KEY
        COPY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT LIT HAS NO ABILITY TO ASSIST YOU IN
        RETRIEVING OR ACCESSING THAT PRIVATE KEY COPY AND ANY VIRTUAL CURRENCY
        YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PRIVATE KEY COPY WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE.
        LIT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND WILL NOT PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR ANY
        OTHER WALLET SOFTWARE YOU MAY USE THIS PRIVATE KEY WITH, AND THAT LIT
        DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT ANY OTHER SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE WILL BE
        COMPATIBLE WITH OR PROTECT YOUR PRIVATE KEY. LIT SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY
        OR RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING. Lit
        is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the
        Services for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of
        these Terms. Lit has the sole right to decide whether you are in
        violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms. In the
        event that we terminate your use of the Services, unless prohibited by
        applicable laws, we will endeavor to contact you and arrange for you to
        download your Private Key Copy to remove any Virtual Currency to another
        Wallet. If we cannot contact you, your Wallet may remain inactive
        through our Services and you will need to retrieve your Private Key Copy
        to access your Wallet using other services or software. Provisions that,
        by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive
        termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive
        termination: any obligation you have to pay us (if applicable) or
        indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding
        ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes
        between us. ## What else do I need to know? ### Warranty Disclaimer.

        no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or
        recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through the

        following such recommendations and suggestions) through the Services are
        provided "AS IS" and without any warranty of any kind from Lit or others

        LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR ANY

        WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
        ERROR-FREE, OR THE SECURITY ASSOCIATED USE OF, OR TRANSMISSION OF
        INFORMATION THROUGH, THE SERVICES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS
        ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU. ### Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding anything to
        the contrary in these Terms, Lit shall be under no obligation to inquire
        into and shall not be liable for any damages, other liabilities or harm
        to any person or entity relating to: - the ownership, validity or
        genuineness of any Virtual Currency; the collectability, insurability,
        effectiveness, marketability or suitability of any Virtual Currency; or
        losses, delays, failures, errors, interruptions or loss of data
        occurring directly or indirectly by reason of circumstances beyond its
        control, including without limitation: acts of God; action or inaction
        of civil or military authority; public enemy; war; terrorism; riot;
        fire; flood; sabotage; epidemics; labor disputes; civil commotion;
        interruption, loss or malfunction of utilities, transportation, computer
        or communications capabilities; insurrection; elements of nature; or
        non-performance by a third party. Notwithstanding anything in these
        Terms to the contrary, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL LIT
        (OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON
        FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
        ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
        STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR
        (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) \$100
        OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO LIT IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES
        IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (C)
        ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE
        EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND
        EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. Indemnity. To the fullest extent
        allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Lit, its
        affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and
        against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and
        consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising
        from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a)
        your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party
        using your account), (b) any content provided through your account, (c)
        your violation of any third party right, including without limitation,
        any copyright, trademark, intellectual property or proprietary right,
        and (d) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim,
        suit, or action ("Claim"), we will attempt to provide notice of the
        Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that
        failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your
        indemnification obligations hereunder). Assignment. You may not assign,
        delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations
        hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or
        otherwise) without Lit’s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign,
        or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations to an affiliate
        or a successor entity without consent. Choice of Law; Arbitration. These
        Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State
        of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
        Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these
        Terms shall be finally settled in Kent County, Delaware, in English, in
        accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of
        Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in
        effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in
        resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who
        shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in
        accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such
        arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each
        party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable
        relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. For all
        purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive
        jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in,
        respectively, Kent County, Delaware. You agree that any arbitration or
        proceedings under these Terms will take place on an individual basis
        between us and you individually, i.e., class arbitrations and class
        actions are not permitted. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no
        arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is
        no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a
        class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii)
        there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a
        purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any
        other persons.YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN
        YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
        PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
        THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND LIT ARE EACH WAIVING THE
        RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. Reporting
        Suspected Vulnerabilities. If you would like to report a vulnerability
        or have a security concern regarding our user-facing and
        developer-related services, SDK, API, infrastructure, and architecture
        etc., please e-mail support@litprotocol.com. Publicity. Lit may include
        and display Customer's name and logo in its lists of customers, its
        public website and marketing materials for promotional purposes and to
        identify Customer as a customer. Customer may request that Lit stop
        doing so by submitting an email to support@litprotocol.com at any time.
        Lit will abide by any written trademark usage guidelines provided by
        Customer. All goodwill arising out of the use of Customer's trademarks
        shall inure to Customer's benefit. Miscellaneous. You will be
        responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes,
        duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity
        in connection with the Services, provided that Lit may, in its sole
        discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it
        sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any
        right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights
        hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable
        or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum
        extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full
        force and effect and enforceable. You and Lit agree that these Terms are
        the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between
        you and Lit, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and
        oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the
        subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you
        are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Lit, and you do
        not have any authority of any kind to bind Lit in any respect
        whatsoever. You and Lit agree there are no third-party beneficiaries
        intended under these Terms. Copyright 2023, All rights reserved.
