# Terms of Service

Lit Association and our affiliates ("Lit" "we" and "us") welcome you. We
invite you to access and use our website located at
Litprotocol.com (the "Website"), and our products, services
and applications (the "Services") that are made available to you
through our Website and other platforms, subject to the following terms
and conditions (the "Terms"). These Terms are a binding contract
between you and Lit. By accessing and using the Website and/or the
Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to
be legally bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy (the "Privacy
Policy"), which is hereby incorporated into these Terms and made a
part hereof by reference (collectively, the "Agreement"). If you do
not agree to any of the terms in the Agreement, you may not access or
use the Website and/or the Services.

If you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or
entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to
these Terms on that organization or entity's behalf and bind them to
these Terms (in which case, the references to "you" and "your"
in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization
or entity.).

In addition, if you are a developer, then your access to and use of our
API and/or SDK shall be governed by the Developer API & SDK License
Agreement. If there is a conflict between these Terms and the terms and
conditions of the Developer API & SDK License Agreement, the terms and
conditions of the Developer API & SDK License Agreement will take
precedence with respect to your use of or access to the API and/or SDK.

THE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION PROVISION. YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT DISPUTES ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL BE SETTLED IN BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU ALSO AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR
PARTICIPATION IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR A JURY TRIAL.

Capitalized terms not defined in these Terms of Service shall have the
meaning set forth in our Privacy Policy.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms
or the Services, please contact us at <support@litprotocol.com>.

## Will these Terms ever change?

We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to
change these Terms along with the Services. We reserve the right to
change the Terms at any time, with or without notice to you. If we
modify the Terms, we will post the modification on the Website and the
Services. By continuing to access or use the Website and/or the Services
after we have posted a modification on the Website and the Services, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Agreement. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site and the Services.

We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may
introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict
access to parts or all of the Services. We reserve the right to remove
any Content (defined below) from the Services at any time, for any
reason in our sole discretion, and without notice.

You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal use, and
not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a
manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the
Services is prohibited by applicable laws or regulations, then you
aren't authorized to use the Services. If permits and licenses are
required for you to use the Services, you must first obtain those prior
to such use. We can't and won't be responsible for your using the
Services in a way that breaks the law or regulations.

## What about my privacy?

Lit takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current Lit User Privacy Policy, please visit <https://litprotocol.com/legal/privacy-policy>.

## What are the basics of using Lit?

The Services enable passwordless authentication and login functionality to distributedly managed keys as well as access control for various sites and applications whose developers have implemented our software ("Developer Apps"). If the developer has integrated with our
Lit software, you will have to create an account to login to a given Developer App and your account on each Developer App is managed by
the developer of the applicable Developer App. Lit has no control or
access to your accounts on the Developer Apps and is not responsible or
liable for your accounts and/or the use or misuse of your accounts.

You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we
will explain additional Service options that are available to you from
time-to-time. Certain Service options are provided to you
free-of-charge, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all
Services in the future. We will notify you before any Services you are
then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such
Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.

As part of our Services, you may directly or indirectly create a digital
wallet that can store and transfer certain supported Virtual Currency
(defined below) (your "Wallet"). In order to use Lit's Services
and create a Wallet, you will be required to established and authenticate via a variety of authorization credentials in order to access your Wallet in order to allow you to initiate a transfer of Virtual Currency from your Wallet, as described further below. Lit allows Developer Apps to use a variety of authorization credentials to create an account linked to your Wallet. You shall not provide us with another
person's authorization credentials, such as phone number or email address. Lit also offers multi-factor authentication as an added security measure, and if you choose to participate, you may need to provide credentials. If you do not establish multi-factor authentication, you may be unable to access your account or your Wallet and we will be unable to assist you, so please make sure to follow any instructions associated with enabling multi-factor authentication.

When you create a Wallet with Lit, a cryptographic private and public
key pair is generated. The private and public key pair together evidence
ownership/possession of a specific amount of supported Virtual Currency in that Wallet which enables you to send and receive Virtual Currency via the relevant Blockchain (as defined below) network. The public key is visible to all participants in a Blockchain's network. The private key must be used to transact the Virtual Currency represented by the corresponding public key. Lit does not store your whole private key in its database and will never request your private key. Lit utilizes AMD-SEV-SNP and threshold cryptography and its own
technology to manage your private key in a process designed
to help ensure its security and confidentiality while ensuring that you
remain in control of your Wallet and private key. Once your private key
is generated, Lit’s software enables you to initiate a
transfer of Virtual Currency using your authorization credentials, like phone number or oAuth, instead of your private key as further described below. You may also choose to export your private key to initiate a transfer of Virtual Currency using another software platform or dashboard. Please note, if you choose to export your private key to your Wallet, you will be solely responsible for maintaining the security of that private key and your Wallet.

When you request to make a transfer of Virtual Currency, in order to
initiate such transfer you will be required to request that Lit validate your authorization credentials. If you have multi-factor authentication enabled, you may also be required to take additional steps. You may only initiate a
transfer using Lit's Services after 2/3rds of the network have confirmed receipt of a valid Transfer Initiation. Lit is entitled to rely on the
Transfer Initiation and has no duty to inquire into or investigate the
validity or accuracy of any Transfer Initiation, though it may, at its
sole discretion, inquire into or investigate such Transfer Initiation.
You will be responsible for keeping your authorization credentials secure
and for any activity associated with your Wallet. Lit
will not be responsible if someone else accesses your phone or computer and authorizes a transaction upon access to your authorization credentials. You should let Lit know immediately if your authorization credentials have been stolen or otherwise compromised.

Lit cannot access raw private key information for you, and we cannot
unilaterally initiate a transfer of Virtual Currency or otherwise access
your Virtual Currency. We are not your brokers, intermediaries, agents,
advisors, or custodians, and we do not have a fiduciary relationship or
obligation to you regarding any other decisions or activities that you
effect when using your Wallet or our Services. We are not responsible
for any activities that you engage in when using your Wallet, and you
should understand the risks associated with Virtual Currency described
more fully below. You are solely responsible for any and all Transfer
Initiations that are initiated through your Wallet and we make no, and
hereby disclaim all, representations, warranties, claims and assurances
as to any Transfer Initiations.

"Virtual Currency" refers to cryptocurrency, digital currency,
digital assets, cryptoassets or other such similar term describing, for
example, Ethereum, but does not include a derivative of a virtual
currency or a security. Virtual Currency is evidenced on, and can be
electronically transferred using, a Blockchain.

"Blockchain" refers to a distributed ledger, maintained by a network
of computers, that records all transactions of Virtual Currency in
theoretically unchangeable data packages known as blocks, each of which are timestamped to reference the previous block, so that the blocks are linked in a chain that evidences the entire history of transactions of the Virtual Currency.

Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional
restrictions:

You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not use the Services or
interact with the Services in a manner that:

- Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other
  rights of anyone else (including Lit);
- Violates any law or regulation, including, without limitation, any
  ⁠applicable export control laws and sanctions laws, including
  restrictions tha prohibit access or use of products or services
  (i) in a country where the U.S. maintains an embargo (including
  Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and the Crimea region, the Donetsk
  People’s Republic (“DNR”) and Luhansk People’s Republic (“LNR”) of
  Ukraine) (“Embargoed Countries”); (ii) by any resident, national, or
  entity established under the laws of any Embargoed Countries; (iii)
  by any party that is on any list of prohibited or restricted parties
  maintained by the U.S. Government or other applicable jurisdictions, including but not limited to Office of Foreign Asset Control’s (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, or other OFAC Lists or Directives, the Entity, Denied Persons, Military End User, and Unverified Lists maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the UN Security Council Consolidated List; (iv) by any party that is owned or controlled by any such restricted or prohibited party; or (v) for the commission of any financial crime or for any illicit purpose; Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable; Jeopardizes the security of your Lit account or anyone else's (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);
- Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other
  security information from any other user;
- Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any
  authorization credentials; or
- Attempts to access another user's account, Wallet or private key or
  credentials on any third-party services that provide access to
  another user's account, Wallet or private key.

A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your
right to use or access the Services.

## Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk Associated with Virtual Currency and Your Wallet

In order to be successfully completed, any Virtual Currency transaction
created with or sent to your Wallet must be confirmed and recorded in a
Blockchain associated with the relevant Virtual Currency. Lit has no
control over any Blockchain and therefore cannot and does not ensure
that any transaction details you submit or receive via our Services will
be confirmed on the relevant Blockchain and does not have the ability to
facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.

You agree and understand that:

- You: (a) have the necessary technical expertise, ability or
  professional advice required to review and evaluate the security,
  integrity and operation of your Wallet to your satisfaction; (b)
  have the knowledge, experience, understanding, professional advice and information to make your own evaluation of the merits, risks and applicable compliance requirements under applicable laws of any use of your Wallet; (c) know, understand and accept the risks associated with your Wallet; and (d) accept the risks associated with Virtual Currency generally and are responsible for conducting your own independent analysis of the risks specific to any Virtual Currency.
- You further assume and agree that Lit will have no responsibility
  or liability for, such risks. You hereby irrevocably waive, release
  and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Lit, its affiliates and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to any of the risks set forth herein.
- You take responsibility for all activities that occur under your
  Wallet or with Virtual Currency sent from your Wallet and accept all
  risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to
  the maximum extent permitted by law.
- Virtual Currency is an emerging asset class. Lit makes no
  warranties as to the markets in which the Virtual Currency are
  transferred, purchased and traded.
- You acknowledge and accept that the loss or destruction of authorization credentials will compromise the security of your Wallet and Virtual Currency and may result in loss of Virtual Currency.
- In the event that you extract your private key to your Wallet as
  further described in these Terms, you acknowledge and accept that you will be solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key, and that the loss or destruction of your private key will compromise the security of your Wallet and Virtual Currency and may result in loss of Virtual Currency.
- The transaction details you submit via the Services may not be
  completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the relevant
  Blockchain used to process the transaction.
- There are no warranties or guarantees that a transfer initiated on
  the Services will successfully transfer title or right in any
  Virtual Currency.
- Once transaction details have been submitted to a Blockchain, Lit
  cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or
  transaction details.
- Lit is not regulated by any federal or state regulatory agency and
  is not subject to the examination or reporting requirements of any
  such agencies.
- Lit does not assume responsibility for any inherent risks
  associated with Blockchain technology, including, but not limited
  to, design or implementation flaws that affect the operation of any
  Blockchain. Furthermore, Lit does not assume responsibility for
  any issues relating to the continuing viability of a Blockchain,
  including, but not limited to, the ability to retain the technical
  expertise required to support a Blockchain or the performance of a
  Blockchain with respect to transaction times.
- Lit makes no guarantee as to the functionality of any Blockchain's
  governance or control mechanisms, which could, among other things, lead to delays, conflicts of interest, or operational decisions that are unfavorable to certain owners of Virtual Currency. You
  acknowledge and accept that the protocols governing the operation of a Blockchain may be subject to sudden changes in operating rules which may materially alter the Blockchain and affect the value and function of Virtual Currency evidenced on that Blockchain.
- Lit does not assume responsibility for fundamental advancements in cryptography which could render inoperative the current cryptography algorithms utilized by a Blockchain supporting a specific Virtual Currency.
- Lit makes no guarantee as to the security of any Blockchain. Lit
  is not liable for any hacks, double spending, stolen Virtual
  Currency, or any other attacks on a Blockchain, including, but not
  limited to, majority attacks in which a nation-state or other party
  with sufficient computing power is able to control and manipulate
  the records of a Blockchain.
- Lit makes no guarantees as to the security of AMD-SEV-SNP and is not liable for any hacks or attacks on AMD’s systems.
- Lit is not liable for any hacks or malicious attempts or phishing
  scams to obtain access to your Wallet via your authorization credentials, such as email address or phone. You alone are responsible for ensuring that you do not provide your authorization credentials to any other person and or entity.

## Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?

Any third-party goods or services, information or content publicly
posted or privately transmitted or made available through the Services
is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such goods, services
or content originated, and you obtain such goods or services and access
all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren't liable
for any errors or omissions or for any damages or losses you might
suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take
any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what
actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content,
and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or
not acquired Content through the Services. We can't guarantee the
identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and
are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.

With respect to all e-mails and communications you send to us,
including, but not limited to, feedback, questions, comments,
suggestions, and the like, we shall be free to use any ideas, concepts,
know-how, or techniques contained in your communications for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, the development, production, and marketing of products and services that incorporate such information without compensation or attribution to you. You represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to provide any of the foregoing, in the manner in which you provide it to us. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.

The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites,
applications or services that are not owned or controlled by Lit, and
typically, you will access our Services through third party websites,
applications or services that integrate with our Services. When you
access third party websites or applications, or when you use third party
services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Lit is
not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you
leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy
policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize.

Lit has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the
content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions
expressed in any third-party websites or by any third party that you
interact with through the Services. In addition, Lit will not and
cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third-party
site or service. Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals
found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of
goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or
representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you
and such organizations and/or individuals. By using the Services, you
release and hold us harmless from any and all liability, losses or
damages arising from your use of any third-party website or service.

If there is a dispute between participants of the Services, or between
users and any third party, you agree that Lit is under no obligation
to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or
more other users, you release Lit, its officers, employees, agents,
and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or
nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or
undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes
and/or our Services.

If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive
California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: \"A general release does
not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know
or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the
release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected
his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."

## What if I want to stop using the Services?

You're free to do that at any time; please refer to our User Privacy
Policy to understand how we treat information you provide to us after
you have stopped using our Services.

If you would like to stop using the Services and export the contents of
your Wallet, you may choose to export a copy of your private key from
your account. Upon electing to export your private key, you will be able
to download a copy of, or directly copy, your private key associated
with the Wallet you are using with Lit (the "Private Key Copy") by
following instructions provided by Lit. Once Lit has provided you
access to your Private Key Copy, you acknowledge and agree that:

LIT DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PRIVATE KEY COPY AND ANY VIRTUAL CURRENCY THAT WAS CONTAINED IN YOUR WALLET ON LIT'S SERVICES. YOU ALONE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR PRIVATE KEY COPY AND KEEPING SUCH PRIVATE KEY COPY SECURE, AND LIT WILL NOT ASSIST YOU WITH STORING YOUR PRIVATE KEY COPY. IF YOU
LOSE ACCESS TO YOUR PRIVATE KEY COPY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT LIT HAS NO ABILITY TO ASSIST YOU IN RETRIEVING OR ACCESSING THAT PRIVATE KEY COPY AND ANY VIRTUAL CURRENCY YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PRIVATE KEY COPY WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE. LIT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND WILL NOT PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR ANY OTHER WALLET SOFTWARE YOU
MAY USE THIS PRIVATE KEY WITH, AND THAT LIT DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT ANY OTHER SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH OR PROTECT YOUR PRIVATE KEY. LIT SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING.

Lit is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the
Services for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of
these Terms. Lit has the sole right to decide whether you are in
violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms. In the
event that we terminate your use of the Services, unless prohibited by
applicable laws, we will endeavor to contact you and arrange for you to
download your Private Key Copy to remove any Virtual Currency to another
Wallet. If we cannot contact you, your Wallet may remain inactive
through our Services and you will need to retrieve your Private Key Copy
to access your Wallet using other services or software.

Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these
Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following
will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us (if
applicable) or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms
regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding
disputes between us.

## What else do I need to know?

obligations hereunder).

your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any
way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Lit’s prior written
consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights

filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental
assessments associated with your activity in connection with the
Services, provided that Lit may, in its sole discretion, do any of the
foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of
either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be
deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of
these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will
be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these
Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
You and Lit agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive
statement of the mutual understanding between you and Lit, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements,
communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter
of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an
