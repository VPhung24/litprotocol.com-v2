### 1. Your Rights and Choices

The CCPA provides consumers with specific rights regarding their Personal Data. This section describes these rights and explains how to exercise them.

#### a. Right to Know About Personal Data

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, disclosure, sale and use of your Personal Data. Once we receive and verify your request, we will disclose to you the following (to the extent applicable to your request):

- The specific pieces of Personal Data we collected about you in the preceding twelve (12) months;

- The categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed or sold your Personal Data in the preceding 12 months.

You may exercise this right up to two times in any 12-month period.

#### b. Right to Request Deletion

You may also have the right to request deletion of your Personal Data. We will honor such request, but might not be able to fulfill your request if we (or our service providers) are required to retain your Personal Data. Examples of such exceptions are:

- Completing a transaction or performing a contract we have with you;
- Detecting and addressing data security incidents, and repairing or upkeep of our IT systems;
- Protecting against fraud or other illegal activity;
- Complying with applicable law or a legal obligation, or to exercise rights under the law (e.g. the right to free speech); or
- Using your Personal Data internally to improve our Services.

#### c. Exercising Your Privacy Rights

To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either: using the following methods:

Email: <support@litprotocol.com>

Online Form: <https://nut.sh/ell/forms/352580/YEk9vu>

##### i. What we need to know to fulfill your request

The verifiable consumer request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Data or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data related to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.

Typically, accounts associated with an email address will require verification of the email address, as well as a description of the requested user rights or regulations invoked. Lit also values those who are not covered by specific regulations, and offers to extend a good will effort towards requests originating from other jurisdictions.

##### ii. How you will hear back from us

We will confirm receipt of a verifiable consumer request within ten (10) business days of its receipt. We will endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) calendar days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will notify you of the extension and provide an explanation of the reason for the extension in writing, and we will provide you with a response no later than ninety (90) calendar days of receipt of the request. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We may charge a reasonable fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer requests if they are excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will inform you of the reasons for this decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

#### d. Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Data

We will not sell your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12 months.

#### e. Right to Non-Discrimination

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. We will not (i) deny you products or services, (ii) charge you different prices or rates for products or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties (except for financial incentives permitted by the CCPA, see below), (iii) provide you a different level or quality of products or services, and (iv) suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for products or services or a different level or quality of products or services.

#### f. Right to Designate an Authorized Agent

If you submit a request to know or delete your Personal Data through the use of an authorized agent, we may require that you (i) provide the authorized agent written permission to act on your behalf, and (ii) verify their identity directly with us. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof of authorization.

  Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to obtain certain information about the types of personal information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship (and that are not otherwise exempt) have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, including the names and addresses of those third parties, and examples of the types of services or products marketed by those third parties.

## GDPR Privacy Notice to European Residents

If you are a resident of the European Union ("EU"), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined in this GDPR Addendum (the "GDPR Addendum").

For this GDPR Addendum, we use the terms "Personal Data" and "processing" as they are defined in the GDPR, but "Personal Data" generally means information that can be used to identify a person, and "processing" generally refers to actions that can be performed on data such as its collection, use, storage or disclosure.

Lit will usually be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services. Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers' end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to customers, in which case we may be the processor of Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.

Where applicable, this GDPR Addendum is intended to supplement, and not replace, our Privacy Policy. If there are any conflicts between the GDPR Addendum and the other parts of the Privacy Policy, and you are a resident of the EU, United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, the provision that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at <support@litprotocol.com>.

**Types of Personal Data we Collect**

We currently collect and otherwise process the kinds of Personal Data listed above in Section I ("Personal Data We Collect and Share") of the Privacy Policy.

**How we Get the Personal Data and why we Have it**

We receive the Personal Data in the ways and for the purposes listed above in Section III ("Sources of Personal Data") and Section IV (Why we Collect, Use and Share Your Data") of the Privacy Policy. We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Under the GDPR, the lawful bases we rely on for processing this information are:
